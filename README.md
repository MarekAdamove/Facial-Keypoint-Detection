# Facial keypoint detection

In this project we try to predict locations of facial keypoints using convolutional neural networks. 

The project has 2 parts:
- *Exploratory Data Analysis*
    - Contains analysis of the dataset such as picture examples, mean locations etc.

- *Modelling*
    - Consists of creating convolutional neural network, training it, evaluating it and comparing with existing EfficientNet network.
